# BattleAI

<p> BattleAi is a game where players can write Java programs to control a single robot and then use it to battle other
players (computer or human). <p>

<h2> Instructions </h2>
<p> This repository includes both the master-server and the regular game. The master-server provides a link to other players through a server browser (others can see your match there once you host it) and handles account statistics such as won matches, win/lose ratio etc. through a database. </p>

<h4> Optional command-line arguments </h4>
<p> <code> -c </code> - starts normally with the console enabled </p>
<p> <code> -s </code> - starts the master-server (requires MySQL database server installed) </p>
<p> <code> -sc </code> - starts the master-server with the console enabled </p>
